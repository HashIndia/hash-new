# Password Reset Email Issue - Diagnosis & Fix

## 🔧 Root Cause Found & Fixed

### ❌ **Main Issue**: Incorrect FRONTEND_URL
**Problem**: Environment variable `FRONTEND_URL` was set to template value `https://your-frontend-app.vercel.app`

**Impact**:

- Users couldn't complete password reset process

**✅ Fix Applied**: Updated `.env` file:

FRONTEND_URL=https://www.hashindia.in
```

#### 2. **Verify Email Address**
- Ensure you're using registered email address
- Check for typos in email input

#### 3. **Email Provider Delays**
- Some providers have 2-5 minute delays
- Brevo typically delivers within 30 seconds

#### 4. **Domain Reputation**
- New domains may have delivery issues
- Brevo helps with deliverability

#### 5. **Check Email Logs**
Monitor backend logs for:
```
📧 [Forgot Password] Request received for email: user@example.com
✅ [Forgot Password] User found: User Name user@example.com
🔑 [Forgot Password] Reset token generated, length: 64
📧 [Forgot Password] Attempting to send email...
