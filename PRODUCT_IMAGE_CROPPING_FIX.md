# Product Image Cropping Fix

## Issue
Product images were being cropped from both sides due to the use of `object-cover` CSS property, which crops images to fit containers perfectly. This was cutting off parts of the product images across the application.

## Solution
Changed from `object-cover` to `object-contain` and added light gray backgrounds to maintain visual consistency.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Shop Page (Shop.jsx)**
- **Changed**: Product grid images from `object-cover` to `object-contain`
- **Added**: Light gray background (`bg-gray-50`) to image containers
- **Effect**: Full product images now visible without cropping

### 2. **Home Page (Home.jsx)**
- **Changed**: Featured product images from `object-cover` to `object-contain`
- **Added**: Light gray background (`bg-gray-50`) to image containers
- **Effect**: Complete featured products visible without side cropping

### 3. **Product Details Page (ProductDetails.jsx)**
- **Main Image**: Changed from `object-cover` to `object-contain` with gray background
- **Thumbnail Images**: Changed from `object-cover` to `object-contain` with gray background
- **Effect**: Full product images visible in detail view and thumbnails

### 4. **Wishlist Page (Wishlist.jsx)**
- **Changed**: Wishlist item images from `object-cover` to `object-contain`
- **Added**: Light gray background (`bg-gray-50`)
- **Effect**: Complete wishlist product images visible

### 5. **Cart Page (Cart.jsx)**
- **Changed**: Cart item thumbnails from `object-cover` to `object-contain`
- **Added**: Proper container div with gray background
- **Effect**: Full product thumbnails in cart without cropping

### 6. **Checkout Page (Checkout.jsx)**
- **Changed**: Order summary item images from `object-cover` to `object-contain`
- **Added**: Container div with gray background
- **Effect**: Complete product images in checkout summary

### 7. **Orders Page (Orders.jsx)**
- **Changed**: Order item images from `object-cover` to `object-contain`
- **Added**: Container div with gray background
- **Effect**: Full product images in order history

### 8. **My Reviews Page (MyReviews.jsx)**
- **Changed**: Product images in review sections from `object-cover` to `object-contain`
- **Added**: Container divs with gray background
- **Effect**: Complete product images in review interface

## Technical Details

### Before (Problematic)
```css
className="w-full h-full object-cover"
```
- **Issue**: `object-cover` crops images to fit container dimensions
- **Result**: Product sides were cut off

### After (Fixed)
```css
className="w-full h-full object-contain"
```
- **Improvement**: `object-contain` shows entire image within container
- **Added**: `bg-gray-50` background for consistent appearance
- **Result**: Complete product images visible
