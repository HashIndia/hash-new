# Orders Page Skeleton Visibility Fix

## Issue
The Orders page skeleton was barely visible due to very light gradient backgrounds with low opacity (e.g., `from-foreground/10 to-foreground/5`), making the loading state nearly invisible to users.

## Solution
Replaced all light gradients with solid, vibrant colors and added shadows for better visibility and professional appearance.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Title Skeleton**
- **Before**: `bg-gradient-to-r from-foreground/10 to-foreground/5`
- **After**: `bg-gray-300` with `shadow-md`
- **Effect**: Clear, visible page title placeholder

### 2. **Order Header Elements**
- **Order ID**: Changed to `bg-purple-300` with `shadow-sm`
- **Order Date**: Changed to `bg-blue-200` with `shadow-sm`
- **Status Badges**: 
  - Status: `bg-green-300` with `shadow-sm`
  - Payment: `bg-yellow-300` with `shadow-sm`
- **Effect**: Clearly visible order identification and status indicators

### 3. **Order Action Buttons**
- **Primary Action**: `bg-purple-400` with `shadow-sm`
- **Secondary Action**: `bg-gray-300` with `shadow-sm`

### 4. **Order Items Section**

### 6. **Shipping Address Section**
- **Title**: Changed to `bg-emerald-400` with `shadow-sm`
- **Address Lines**: Changed to `bg-stone-300` with `shadow-sm`

  - Date: `bg-amber-300` with `shadow-sm`
- **Effect**: Clear order tracking visualization

## Color Strategy

### **Color Coding System**
- **Purple/Indigo**: Primary actions and totals
- **Blue/Cyan**: Product and status information
- **Green/Emerald**: Success states and confirmations
- **Yellow/Amber**: Warnings and timestamps
- **Gray/Stone**: Neutral information
- **Pink/Rose**: Special highlights
- **Orange/Teal**: Secondary details

### **Enhanced Visibility Features**
- **Solid Colors**: Replaced transparent gradients with opaque colors
- **Shadow Effects**: Added `shadow-sm` and `shadow-md` for depth
- **High Contrast**: Used colors with sufficient contrast ratios
- **Animation**: Maintained `animate-pulse` for loading indication

## Technical Details

### Before (Problematic)
```jsx
className="h-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-foreground/15 to-foreground/10 rounded w-32 animate-pulse"
```
- **Issue**: Very light gradients were barely visible
- **Opacity**: 10-15% transparency made elements nearly invisible

### After (Fixed)
```jsx
className="h-6 bg-purple-300 rounded w-32 animate-pulse shadow-sm"
```
- **Improvement**: Solid colors with proper opacity
- **Visibility**: Clear, distinguishable placeholder elements
- **Polish**: Added shadows for professional appearance
